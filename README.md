## Getting Started üèÅ

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-analysis-system.git
cd weather-analysis-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 3. Get Your Weather API Key
Sign up for an API key at OpenWeatherMap. Then, add the key to your environment variables or settings.py file.

### 4. Update settings.py
Add your API key in settings.py:
API_KEY = 'your-openweather-api-key-here'

### 5. Apply Migrations
Run the migrations to set up the database.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
### 6. Collect Static Files
Run the following command to collect static files:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### 7. Run the Application
You can now run the server locally:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Go to http://localhost:8000 to access the app.
### 8. API endpoint:
Fetch All the details of weather for a particular place: http://127.0.0.1:8000/fetch/

## Deployment üì¶
To deploy the Django app on Render, follow these steps:
1. Ensure Gunicorn is installed and configured.
2. Update the start command in Render's dashboard:
```bash
gunicorn weather_analysis.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```
3. Set environment variables (such as SECRET_KEY and API_KEY) on Render.
4. Run collectstatic for static file management.

## Configuration for Production üè≠
In your settings.py:
```bash
Set DEBUG = False.
```
Use WhiteNoise to serve static files:
```bash
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'
```
Add your deployed domain to ALLOWED_HOSTS:
```bash
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-app-name.onrender.com']
```
## Environment Variables üîê
Ensure the following environment variables are set in your environment:
1. SECRET_KEY: Your Django secret key.
2. API_KEY: The API key for the weather service.
3. DEBUG: Set to False in production.
